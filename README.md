# Battleship-Project

A Battleship game using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. TDD principles were followed during the process, so the project includes some tests (with Jest).

In this version the AI randomly attacks the player's grid . The project will be updated to make the AI try adjacent slots after getting a ‘hit’.
